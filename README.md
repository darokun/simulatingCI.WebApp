## Simulating Confidence Intervals

This is a web application created with [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), built on the `CIsim` function from the package [PASWR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PASWR/PASWR.pdf) by [Alan T. Arnholt](https://github.com/alanarnholt), and published on [Shinyapps](http://www.shinyapps.io/).

Unlike the `CIsim` function, this web application can momentarily only calculate confidence intervals for the population mean, obtained by simulating random samples from a normal distribution.

Further updates might enable the web application to calculate confidence intervals for the population variance or the population proportion of sucesses.

To use:

1. Visit [https://darokun.shinyapps.io/notes](https://darokun.shinyapps.io/notes)
2. Input the desired values.
3. Click the **Submit** button.
4. Enjoy!
